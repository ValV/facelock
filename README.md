# Facelock: face detection and alignment application

## Description

This program is a demo of face detection and alignment methods in an OpenCV application.

## Details

### Pretrained models

This version uses pretrained TensorFlow model for SSD DNN. Model itself was taken from [OpenCV extra repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/tree/master/testdata/dnn). Weights for the model were taken from [OpenCV 3rd party repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/tree/dnn_samples_face_detector_20180220_uint8).

Face alignment Kazemi method uses pretrained data from [OpenCV 3rd party repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_3rdparty/tree/contrib_face_alignment_20170818) as well.

## TODO

- [ ] Add face classifier
